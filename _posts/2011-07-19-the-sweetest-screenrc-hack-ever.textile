title: The sweetest .screenrc hack ever!

I've been using screen on remote machines a lot these days but I found myself getting frustrated with the lack of useful information in the tab titles. What I wanted was for the title to display the current working directory if I was at the command prompt and the name of the running program if I was running something else. As demonstrated above, I succeeded (by hacking together a bunch of google search results)!

First you have to add this to your .screenrc:

{% highlight bash %}
shelltitle "$ |bash"
{% endhighlight %}

Where @$@ is the delimiter at the end of your bash command prompt and @bash@ is the default tab title (you shouldn't actually ever see this!). Then you add this to your @.bashrc@:

{% highlight bash %}
# command prompt... HOLY SHIT MAGIC!
case $TERM in
    screen*)
        SCREENTITLE='\[\ek\e\\\]\[\ek\W\e\\\]'
        ;;
    *)
        SCREENTITLE=''
        ;;
esac
export PS1="${SCREENTITLE}[\u@\h \W]\$ "
{% endhighlight %}

First, it checks whether or not you're in screen then it sets your command prompt accordingly. The thing that you'll want to change is in the last line. I like my standard command prompt to be ==<code>[\u@\h \W]\$</code>== but you should change this to whatever you want (but don't forget the @$@ at the end!).
