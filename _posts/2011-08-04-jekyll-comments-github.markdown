    title: Jekyll blog comments for nerds
    excerpt: How to use GitHub forks for commenting on Jekyll blogs.
---

I like GitHub a lot. That's why I host many of my projects on it and even my
blog.  In that spirit, I decided to code up a (mildly convoluted) way of
posting comments on my [static Jekyll blog](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
using GitHub forks.

If you click on the "post a comment" link, below, it will -- after checking
with you first -- fork the source for this page using your GitHub
account and then let you edit it. After you add your comment, you can simply
submit it as a pull request.

## How to add a comment

At the very end of the document, you'll find a line that looks like:

{% highlight text %}
* github-username - January 1, 2012 - Your comment...
{% endhighlight %}

All you need to do is copy this line, add your GitHub username and your
comment (written in Markdown syntax) then submit a pull request. You're also
welcome to make changes to the post if you have any suggestions for tweaks.
It's not elegant but it _is_ a novelty! Let me know what you think in the
comments section below.

## Comments

* github-username - January 1, 2012 - Your comment...
* dfm - August 5, 2011 - This is what a comment looks like!
  Let me know what you think...
* jonathansick - August 6, 2011 - If spam-bots start figuring out how to
  make comments... that'll be the day...
* jakemannix - November 14, 2011 - Given the relative difficulty of
  making comments like this, I'm pretty sure that this will be the most
  spam-free blog in the blogosphere.  It may also be the most
  _comment_-free blog as well, but that's O.K.!  Nice work.
* davidwhogg - 2012-08-03 - I think you should require
  [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date formatting.
* ninehills - August 10, 2012 - Better than disqus!
* branduren - October 14, 2012 - Neatly done :)
