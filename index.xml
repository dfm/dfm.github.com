      <title>What if I want to reuse my Python functions?</title>

      <description>This post is an introduction to packaging Python code aimed at scientists (although the advice is probably more general) who want to be able to reuse Python functions that they have written as part of a common Jupyter notebook-based development workflow. It is not meant as a complete discussion of Python packaging for scientific software. Some day I&amp;rsquo;d love to write more about that (because I have so many thoughts and opinions), but in the meantime I&amp;rsquo;ll direct you to other resources like the excellent OpenAstronomy Python packaging guide, if you want more details.</description>

      <title>Extending JAX with custom C&#43;&#43; and CUDA code</title>
      <link>https://dfm.io/posts/extending-jax/</link>

      <description>The primary version of this post can be found on GitHub: dfm/extending-jax
 This repository is meant as a tutorial demonstrating the infrastructure required to provide custom ops in JAX when you have an existing implementation in C++ and, optionally, CUDA. I originally wanted to write this as a blog post, but there&amp;rsquo;s enough boilerplate code that I ended up deciding that it made more sense to just share it as a repo with the tutorial in the README, so here we are!</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Dan Foreman-Mackey I&amp;rsquo;m a Research Engineer at Google Deepmind in New York City. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on JAX. I used to be an astrophysicist who developed some open source scientific software.
Code I write a lot of code for work and in my spare time. All my projects live in public repositories on GitHub. Here are some of my most popular research codes:
