<p>At the last minute, my friend <a href="http://adrian.pw/" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Adrian P-W</a> and I found
ourselves in charge of chairing the Hack Day at the 225th meeting of the
American Astronomical Society that happened Jan 5–8 in Seattle.
This is a job usually left to my charismatic PhD advisor,
<a href="http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Hogg</a>, who wrote blog posts about the previous
AAS hack days
(<a href="http://hoggresearch.blogspot.com/2013/01/aas-hack-day_10.html" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>2013</a> and

Astrobetter</a>).
Hack days are a relatively new addition to this meeting and to the
astronomical community but they are always fun and productive.
This day was no exception!</p>
<p>Before the hack day, there were <a href="https://twitter.com/exoplaneteer/status/552917957404160000" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>boards set up in the poster room at the
meeting</a> and <a href="http://www.astrobetter.com/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=AASHackDay" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>a
page on the Astrobetter
wiki</a> for
people to list their hack ideas.
There was also quite a bit of activity on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hackaas?f=realtime" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>the Twitter
feed</a>.
Then, on the day, there were about 75 people in the room and roughly half had
previously attended a hack day of some sort.
The day started with hack pitches then after a quick coffee break, we got down
to work.
The main point of this hack day is to spend a full day focusing on a single
project that you don&rsquo;t normally have time for but that you&rsquo;ve been wanting to
work on or learn about.
The hacks are by no means required to be code-related but for practical and
sociological reasons, they often are.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, after about five hours of hacking, we regrouped and everyone
reported on what they had been up to.
I don&rsquo;t have space to list all the awesome hacks but here are a few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Angus (Oxford/CfA) and Montet (Caltech) built a Twitter &ldquo;troll-bot&rdquo; that
listened for people tweeting about air travel (optionally with the
#academicnomad hash tag) and responded with an estimate of their carbon
footprint. Unfortunately it looks like they have since been banned from
Twitter for violating the terms of service.
[<a href="https://github.com/RuthAngus/trollbot" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>code</a>]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Davenport (UW), Morris (UW), Fiore-Silvast (UW), DeStefano (UW),
Holachek (ADS), and Bianco (NYU) extended <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3091" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Davenport et
al. (2013)</a>&rsquo;s study of the gender
distribution of question askers at the meeting. One key result from this
year&rsquo;s analysis was that if the <em>first</em> question is asked by a woman, the
gender distribution of subsequent questions is more representative of the
meeting&rsquo;s overall gender distribution (60% M / 40% F) versus the average
distribution of question askers over all sessions (80% M / 20% F).
What causes of this difference?

   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>analysis</a>]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partly to answer some of the questions raised by results like the above
gender study in more detail, Schwamb (ASIAA), Salyk (NOAO), and Avestruz
(Yale) developed <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mPxiaTIKUBl2BAt1KF6OWJ2LOdsQCdfMk-KTbn9vMgc/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>a
survey</a>
aimed at answering the question: &ldquo;why do people ask questions?&rdquo; Some
results were in but a full analysis wasn&rsquo;t finished by the end of the hack
day. I&rsquo;m looking forward to hearing what they find (and I think
they&rsquo;re still accepting responses)!

<p>Inspired by the visualizations created for <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/19/illusions/a-quick-spin-around-the-big-dipper" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"

(that she wrote), Ash (Columbia) figured out how to use Worldwide Telescope
to render the constellations in 3D and view them from different angles.
It turns out that constellations are just projection effects ;-).

<p>For all of your music discovery needs, DJ Carly Sagan (NYC), Rice
(CUNY/AMNH), and Lee (Harvard) started a collaborative playlist on
Spotify for astronomy related tunes. It currently has 637 songs (two days
of constant listening and Total Eclipse of the Heart is only on there about
six times) from many different contributors. Add your favorite astrosongs
now!

<p>To study gendered trends in publication practices and coauthorship, Bianco
(NYU), Morehead (PSU), Wang (NYU) Li (Swarthmore), Senchyna (UW), and Lee
(Harvard) downloaded about 5000 papers from ADS and estimated the genders
of the first few authors using first names. Most of the hack day was spent
scraping and managing the
data (that&rsquo;s called &ldquo;data science&rdquo;) so they didn&rsquo;t have time to come to any
solid conclusions but they did produce an awesome dataset.

<p>Rogers &amp; Donaldson (MAST) collaborated to put together a prototype of a
very lightweight visual interface to the MAST catalogs and imaging. The app
is web-based but it is designed to used on mobile devices.
I think that this will be useful for both research and teaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VanderPlas (UW), Douglas (Columbia), Morton (Princeton), Peters (Drexel),
and Hollowood (UCSC) worked together to develop a consistent API for time
series analysis to be incorporated into the <a href="https://github.com/astroML/astroML" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>AstroML
package</a>. By the end of the hack day,
they had implemented Lomb-Scargle and Supersmoother complete with unit
tests and a full API specification. That&rsquo;s how I like to see code
released!
[<a href="https://github.com/astroML/periodogram" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>code</a>]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finkbeiner (CfA) hacked the IDL image-viewing platform, ATV, to show a
movie of posterior samples instead of static figures. Everyone in the room
gasped when he demonstrated that you can zoom, pan, <em>etc.</em> as you normally
would while the samples continue to animate. How do we include this in
papers now? Finkbeiner uses IDL and the classic email-me-to-get-the-code
license but this is impressive enough work that I guess we&rsquo;ll have to
forgive him.

<p>A huge thanks goes to Kelle Cruz (CUNY/AMNH) and Meg Schwamb (ASIAA) for
organizing the event, Debbie Kovalsky (AAS Meetings) for logistics, and our
sponsors, Northrop Grumman and LSST, for the snacks and lunch.
I&rsquo;d also like to thank everyone who attended for making it such a fun day.</p>

Programming expertise is <em>not</em> necessary and hacks do not even need to be code
based.
One example might be <a href="https://twitter.com/ashpags/status/552709347944312833" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>to make more knitted astronomy
mascots</a> at the Hack
Days.

hesitations, please feel free to reach out to
